- 5/1/2022: [Talker/80 noise reduction quick hack:](https://youtu.be/PXlzUbNzO18) If you are using the speaker & built-in PAM amplifier, depending on your speaker, you might get quite a bit of hissing noise. There is an easy fix for that - just pull the op-amp! The op-amp is only needed for line out. And line out and speaker are mutually exclusive anyways, as they require completely different mixing levels. So - op-amp is needed for line out only, else it is better to just pull it, and this will remove all the noise. All ICs are socketed, so this is easy to do. 

- 3/30/2022: [Talker/80 with PocketTRS by John Dias!](https://youtu.be/__6tL8iR-zk) PocketTRS is a great Model III / 4 in your pocket! And it has a real expansion port - works with FreHD, and also with Talker/80. Great stuff, thanks for posting - not sure why the deep and slow voice (the default voice is actually quite a bit faster and higher in pitch), but hey, why not :-) Thanks for posting, John Dias!

 - 5/21/2020: One of the first Talker/80 users has published a positive review on the [Vintage Computer Forum.](http://www.vcfed.org/forum/showthread.php?74036-Talker-80-New-Voice-Synthesizer-in-the-Making/page4) Review from **Alphasite:** 

>I've had my Talker/80 for a couple of days.
>
>My first impression is this is very nice board and the fact that it emulates multiple voice synthesizers for the Model I is amazing.
>
>My first test was to connect it to my Model I and Expansion Interface and use the HFE image provided in the Github page. I ran all the included tests successfully. I was very impressed.
>
>My next test was to connect the Talker/80 to the Model I directly and then connect a Quinnterface/FreHD to the Talker/80. For this the power on sequence is critical. You must power on the Talker/80 first, then the Q/F combo. I didn't wait long enough and the Talker/80 would hang. The power on sequence is mentioned in the documentation and I found that if I waited for the Talker/80 to finish with the startup message before powering on the Q/F I was able to boot. It may not be necessary to wait that long but I didn't test because it's only a matter of a couple of seconds.
>
>My latest test was to try the Talker/80 with the MIRE and MISE. First I connected the MIRE to the Model I and then the Talker/80. I had this all on a power switch and they powered on at the same time and there wasn't an issue. I had the Talking Eliza program loaded on my MIRE emulated floppy from testing a Radio Shack Voice Synthesizer so I set the dip switches on the Talker/80 to start up in RS VS mode and reset. I then ran Talking Eliza and it worked perfectly. I then powered everything off and connected the MISE to the expansion connector on the Talker/80 and powered everything up again. Again everything came up without any issues. The Talking Eliza program still worked.

>Did I mention that I am very impressed? 

 - 5/23/2020: Firmware sources and Gerbers added. 
 - 5/24/2020: Link to Seeed Gallery for PCB ordering added. Note that there is also the OshPark link - the OshPark PCBs have far superior quality (copper instead of tin!), but are also a bit more pricey. However, the higher quality might pay off especially considering the Talker/80 expansion port connector  passthrough.

Talker/80 uses GPL 3. This code uses the [Epson S1V30120 firmware image]( https://github.com/MikroElektronika/Click_TextToSpeech_S1V30120/blob/master/library/include/text_to_speech_img.h)
from the [TextToSpeech click board library from MikroElektronika released under GPL2.](

By using this code, you are also bound to the [Epson license terms for the S1V30120 firmware.](https://global.epson.com/products_and_drivers/semicon/products/speech/voice/sla/s1v30120_init_data.html)  

## Requirements 

This project was developed using
[WinAVR.](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) In addition, the [AVR
Programming Libraries](https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming)
from Elliot Williams' book "Make: AVR Programming" are being used. 


## Introduction

Talker/80 offers: 

  1. **DECtalk-Based Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis:** the **Epson S1V30120 TTS** chip on the utilized mikroBUS "TextToSpeech Click!" daughterboard from MikroElektronika implements DECtalk v5 - a natural sounding speech synthesizer for English and Spanish, with different voices. DECtalk can even sing. The **DECtalk mode** is very powerful and versatile, but the DECtalk control language can be difficult to program. Hence, a simplified control language for the S1V30120 is offered as well, the so-called **Epson mode**. DECtalk mode is used to implement **emulations of two classic TRS-80 Voice Synthesizers**: the official TRS Voice Synthesizer from Tandy Radio Shack (Model 1 only), and the VS-100 Voice Synthesizer from Alpha Products (Model 1, 3, and 4). Both use the **Votrax SC-01** as their underlying speech chip. Talker/80 emulates the SC-01 by means of DECtalk here. The DECtalk and Epson modes produce superior speech quality, and text-to-speech is performed by Talker/80 itself, i.e., no breaking down into phonemes is required. Text to be spoken can be sent directly to IO port 11, and the status of the speech synthesizer is checked by reading from port 11. 

  2. **TRS Voice Synthesizer Emulation - MODEL 1 VERSION ONLY**: the emulation in terms of DECtalk as just described is good enough to produce understandable speech, but it sounds different than the Votrax SC-01 chip. Original software such as the TRS Voice Synthesizer BASIC Demo Program, and "Talking Eliza" work out of the box, but note that the emulation is only 80% faithful or so. Also, original software written for the TRS Voice Synthesizer will only work on Talker/80 for the Model 1. The Model 3 / 4 version offers a workaround (see below), but requires manual software conversion.  

 3. **VS-100 Voice Synthesizer from Alpha Products Emulation**: another classic TRS-80 voice synthesizer. Also used the Votrax SC-01, but was / is not compatible with the TRS Voice Synthesizer. Talker/80 uses the same method of emulation (mapping to DECtalk phonemes). Same comments wrt. buffering etc. apply. Original software works without patches (e.g., VS48 and VS-100DEMO.BAS etc.). In addition, **pitch control is currently no supported**, so the speech will be monotonous. 

 4. **Cassette Sound Input Port and Audio Mixer**: Talker/80 is equipped with two input stero mini jacks - one for the output from the MikroElektronika speech daughterboard, and one can be connected to the TRS 80 Cassette Output Port for sound (or any other source, really). The signals are being mixed. Two input pots on the right and corresponding trimmers on the left side are used to determine the two signal levels for the mix. The mixed LM741 output signal is available at the output mini jack on the left side. 

 5. **Optional Amplifier and Loudspeaker**: In addition, a little "off the shelf" D-class audio amplifier can be fitted on the PCB. The two input signals (after the pots / trimmers) is being amplified. The output is available to the loudspeaker pin header at the back of the PCB. The output volume is controlled by the trimmer / pot at the top right.  

 6. **Expansion Port Pass Through Connector**: The *Model 1 Talker/80* connects directly to the Model 1 expansion port, or, if an Expansion Interface (EI) is available, to the Expansion Port passthrough of the EI (this is the port in the left front corner on the left side). The Talker/80 expansion port edge connector is at the back of the PCB. You can either connect the EI directly to the Model 1, or to Talker/80's edge connector. Talker/80 is fully compatible with the EI, Floppy Disks, FreHD, etc. The *Model 3 / 4 Talker/80* connects to the expansion port of the TRS-80 using the 50pin ribbon cable. 

 7. **DIP Switch for Initial Mode Selection**: for selecting the intial startup mode of Talker/80. The mode can be changed via software as well (by sending a so-called "control byte"). 

 8. **RESET button**: for reinitializing / "rebooting" Talker/80. In combination with the DIP switch, the mode can be changed easily without having to use software to send control bytes. 

 9. **Three LEDs**: These LEDs are used for mode indiciation, to signal data being received, to indicate when Talker/80 is speaking, and when a single phoneme is being uttered. LEDs will also indicate errors. 


A main difference between the DECtalk-based emulation and the original synthesizers is that it is not possible to utter phonemes "in realtime", as DECtalk requires phoneme buffering and processing before they can be spoken, unlike the SC-01, which is able to utter a phoneme immediatly (they can, for example, be used as "realtime sound effects"). This is exploited, for example, in the TRS Voice Synthesizer BASIC Demo Program, which spells out individual phonemes in real time ("the phonemes in the word zero are: z e r o" etc.) Due to the buffering requirement for DECtalk, this is challenging to get right. Please check out my demo videos below to see if you can live with the result. 


## TRS-80 Model 1 Connection & Startup Sequence 

![Model 1 Board](images/explanation.jpg)
![Model 1 Board Backside](images/explanation-back.jpg)

Talker/80 gets its power from a standard, voltage stabilized **5V power supply** ("Wall Wart") with **positive center polarity**, **5.5 mm x 2.5mm**.  It connects to the Talker/80 Barrel Jack.  

It is very important that your equipment is powered on in the right order of sequence: 

 1. Make sure everything is powered off. 
 2. Make sure everything is connected correctly (Talker/80 to the Model 1, Expansion Interface (EI) to Talker/80 if present - note that it does not require the Expansion Interface). Alternatively, you can also keep the EI directly connected to the Model 1, and connect Talker/80 to the EI Expansion Port passthrough port (the edge in the left front corner on the left side of the EI). 
 3. Supply power to Talker/80 by plugging in the PSU. You should hear "Talker/80 initialized" and an announcement of the current mode, which depends on the settings of the DIP switches. 
 4. Power on your Floppy Drives, Printer, etc. 
 5. Power on the Expansion Interface. 
 6. Power on the Model 1. 

## TRS-80 Model 3 / 4 Connection & Startup Sequence 

Same as for Model 1, but use the 50pin ribbon cable. The Talker/80
passthrough connector can be connected to the FreHD HD emulator, an
Orchestra-90, or likewise. It is very important that your equipment is
powered on in the right order of sequence. First power on the expansions (Talker/80, FreHD, ...), and then the Model 3 / Model 4.

## Hardware Description

Talker/80 uses an ATmega 644-20 (U4) clocked at 16 MHz as its microcontroller. The firmware has ~ 45 KBs. The firmware was programmed in C, using the WinAVR / GCC toolchain. At startup, the ATmega loads the Epson firmware image (implementing DECtalk) over SPI into the speech daughterboard. At runtime, SPI is used as well. External interupts are being used to register read and write requests. The address decoding is done by a GAL20V10 (U1), and another GAL20V10 (U2) is acting as a tristate databus latch and also provides status input (bits 6 and 7) to the TRS-80 in all modes other than the TRS Voice Synthesizer emulation mode. U5 is the op-amp.  The programming / firmware of the address decoder GAL U1 used for the Model 3 / 4 version differs from the Model 1 version. All other chips (and their programming) are identical. 

The current mode of Talker/80 is being signaled to the address decoder GAL U2, using 2 bits for the 4 different modes. Depending on the mode, the GAL U2 eiher decodes IO requests (using IN and OUT signals), or video RAM addresses (and signals RD and WR) to implement "video RAM snooping" (a form of memory-based IO) as required for the TRS Voice Synthesizer. The details can be found in the GAL code. This only works on the Model 1, since the Model 3 / 4 doesn't support memory-based IO. 

Applications can read from IO port 11 to find out if Talker/80 is actively speaking. Note that input to Talker/80 is always buffered, so realtime control of the speaking process (e.g., "voice synthesizer sound effects") is not achievable. As usual, the ``EXTIOSEL`` signal is being used on the Model 3 / 4 to signal an IO read request from port 11. 

### Address Decoding in the Epson and DECtalk Modes  

Talker/80 **listens to port 11**. For the text content, 7 bit ASCII is being used. The text-to-speech conversion is performed internally, so no phoneme encoding on the TRS-80 side is  required. Input from IO port 11 is being buffered. The buffer has a size of 256 bytes. A **return  (CR / ASCII code 13)** initiates the text to speech process, and Talker/80 starts to speak (if the buffer had content). While it speaks, bits 6 and 7 of port 11 will be low - use ``inp(11) AND 192`` to check for bits 6 and 7 being set in BASIC. **Note that the status of the other bits will be undefined, especially on the Model 3 / 4.** 

ASCII characters being sent to port 11 which have its 8th bit (Bit 7) set (i.e., bytes > 127) are being interpreted as **control bytes**. Control bytes are used to control the Talker/80, i.e., to change its current mode, to change parameters of the speech (voice, speak rate, volume), etc. The list of control bytes is given below. For example, to reset Talker/80, send 255 to IO port 11 (use ``out 11,255`` in BASIC).    

Speech can be **blocking or non-blocking**. In the blocking mode, the Z80 CPU is suspended by pulling its ``WAIT`` input low. 

### Address Decoding in the VS-100 Mode 

The primary IO port the VS-100 is also port 11. And like in the Epson and DECtalk modes, one can read the status from port 11. Bits 6 and 7 (the byte starts with Bit 0) indicate if it is busy speaking. 

*For the Model 1 version, lazy / partial address decoding is being used,* just like in the original VS-100. Partial address decoding was used to reduce the address decoder complexity and hence chip count and costs. According to information from members of the Vintage Computer Forum, the following IO ports can also be used to address the VS-100  ("it responds if bits 7, 5, 4 and 2 are 0, don't care for others"):

- 0, 1, 2, 3
- 8, 9, 10, **11** 
- 64, 65, 66, 67
- 72, 73, 74, 75

However, since the VS-100 software only seems to address the VS-100 hardware using port 11, and to reduce the possibility of address conflicts with other hardware extensions, the *Model 3 / 4 version of Talker/80 does full address decoding* and consequently **only** listens to port 11. 

Unlike the DECtalk and EPSON modes, text to speech / encoding of text into phonemes has to be performed on the TRS-80 side. SC-01 phonemes are being sent, not ASCII text characters. 

These are the SC-01 phonemes; the VS-100 phonemes are identical: 
![SC-01 Phonemes](images/sc01-phonemes.jpg)

Note that, in order to do the text-to-speech / phoneme mapping, the VS-100 software driver can be used (the programs ``VS48`` and ``VS32``). These drivers allow text-to-speech from BASIC then, so the driver performs the text to phoneme mapping.   

Talker/80 **does not implement the pitch control feature of the SC-01.** The VS-100 uses the last two bits (Bits 6 and 7) of the phoneme bytes to encode / provide pitch control; i.e., each phoneme has in principle 4 different "pronounciations" or "pitches".  These two pitch bits on phonemes are currently being ignored by Talker/80 and hence not supported. To prevent interference with existing VS-100 software, the control bytes understood by Talker/80 in the DECtalk and EPSON modes, are NOT supported in the VS-100 mode. 

Since control bytes are not accepted in this mode, all changes to the default settings need to be made BEFORE entering the VS-100 mode. For example, if a different voice, speech rate or volume is required in the VS-100 mode, then make these changes to the setting from the EPSON or DECtalk mode first, and then enter the VS-100 mode from using the corresponding control byte `&EB`. The changed voice synthesizer settings will then carry over to the VS-100 mode. The mode can only be exited by using the RESET button. 

Here is a picture of the **original VS-100 Voice Synthesizer:** 

![VS-100 Synth](images/vs100-voice-synth.png)
    
### Address Decoding in the TRS Voice Synthesizer Mode

The TRS Voice Synthesizer uses memory-based IO. 
It snoops writes to the video RAM in the address range ``$3FE0 .. $3FFF``. Only the temporal order of writes matters, not the actual address from that range.  Hence, in this mode, any write (WR signal) in that address range will put a byte in the Talker/80 speech buffer.  

A special protocol is being used. Even though the TRS Voice Synthesizer employs the same speech chip as the VS-100, the SC-01, it is not using the SC-01 phonemes directly. Rather, Tandy Radio Shack invented a "printed" phoneme character set for some of the SC-01 phonemes. A special character, the "?" opens and closes the "window" to the Voice Synthesizer. 

The TRS Voice Synthesizer's printed ASCII phonemes for some of the SC-01 phonemes are the following: 

![TRS Voice Synthesizer Printed Phonemes](images/trs-phonemes.jpg)

Note that, like in the VS-100, control bytes are not accepted in this mode, as normal "to screen" printing  might otherwise trigger them. If a different voice setting is required in the TRS Voice Synthesizer mode (e.g., a different voice, speech rate or volume), then the setting must be changed from the EPSON or DECtalk mode first, and then the TRS Voice Synthesizer mode be entered using the control bytes `&ED` or `&EC`. The changed voice synthesizer settings will carry over to the new mode, and be active from now on. The TRS Voice Synthesizer mode can only be exited via the RESET button (since no control bytes are accepted). 

*On the Model 3 / 4, the TRS Voice Synthesizer mode can be enabled, but the TRS Voice Synthesizer software will not work properly, due to the impossibility of memory-mapped IO on the Model 3 / 4. However, the TRS Voice Synthesizer emulation can be addressed via IO port 11 and will be working properly if the printed ASCII phonemes are being sent to this port, rather than printed on the screen. Hence, TRS Voice Synthesizer software can be ported by replacing the ``print@"<X>`` (where ``<X>`` is a TRS Voice Synthesizer phoneme) statements with proper ``out 11,asc(<X>)`` statements. Again, this is only necessary for the Model 3 / Model 4 version of Talker/80.* 

Here is a picture of the **original TRS Voice Synthesizer:** 

![VS-100 Synth](images/trs-voice-synth.jpg)

### Phoneme Tables and Phoneme Mappings  

The VS-100 and TRS Voice Synthesizer Emulations work by mapping SC-01 phonemes to DECtalk "close enough equivalents". This produces understandable speech, but the resulting speech sounds different from the original SC-01. 

Talker/80 implements the following mapping from SC-01 phonemes to DECtalk phonemes: 


    void init_allophones(void) {

      // VOTRAX SC01 -> ARPABET (DECTALK) 

      sc01_map[0x00] = "ih"; // EH3 jackEt
      sc01_len[0x00] = 59;

      sc01_map[0x01] = "eh"; // EH2 Enlist   
      sc01_len[0x01] = 71;

      sc01_map[0x02] = "eh"; // EH1 hEAvy  
      sc01_len[0x02] = 121; 

      sc01_map[0x03] = "_";  // PA0 Pause 
      //sc01_map[0x03] = "";  // PA0 Pause 
      sc01_len[0x03] = 47;

      sc01_map[0x04] = "t"; // DT buTTer 
      sc01_len[0x04] = 47;

      sc01_map[0x05] = "ey"; // A2 mAde

      sc01_map[0x06] = "ey"; // A1 mAde

      sc01_map[0x07] = "zh"; // ZH aZure
      sc01_len[0x07] = 90;

      sc01_map[0x08] = "aa"; // AH2 hOnest
      sc01_len[0x08] = 71;

      sc01_map[0x09] = "ah"; // I3 inhibIt 
      sc01_len[0x09] = 55;

      sc01_map[0x0a] = "ih"; // I2 Inhibit 
      sc01_len[0x0a] = 80;

      sc01_map[0x0b] = "ih"; // I1 InhIbit 
      sc01_len[0x0b] = 121; 

      sc01_map[0x0c] = "m"; // M Mat
      sc01_len[0x0c] = 103;

      sc01_map[0x0d] = "n"; // N suN
      sc01_len[0x0d] = 80;

      sc01_map[0x0e] = "b"; // B Bag
      sc01_len[0x0e] = 71;

      sc01_map[0x0f] = "v"; // V Van

### The Talker/80 Printed Circuit Board (PCB) 

Talker/80 was made with [KiCad EDA v4.0.7](http://kicad-pcb.org/),
and "freeRouting.jar" did the routing.

![Switches and LEDs](images/switches-and-leds.jpg)

The DIP switches are used for initial boot / startup mode selection (note that the mode can be changed later by sending a control byte); for switch 1, 2 from left to right: 

  - **0n 0n**: EPSON Mode. 
  - **0n Off**: TRS Voice Synthesizer Mode. 
  - **Off On**: VS-100 Voice Synthesizer Mode. 
  - **Off Off**: DECtalk Mode.     

The LEDs have the following meaning - during startup and after mode selection, they briefly indicate the selected mode. The blink in case of errors. In normal operation, they have the following meaning:    

 - **D1:** Incoming data.  
 - **D2:** On if a single phoneme is being uttered, and when the "stop speech" command is being processed. 
 - **D3:** Actively speaking.

#### Model 1 Version

[Gerbers of the Model 1 version can be found here.](gerbers/m1/talker80-v3.zip) 

A version is also hosted on [OshPark for immediate ordering of PCBs.](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/RE78tFPR) And [another one on Seeed.](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Talker-80-Voice-Synthesizer-for-the-TRS-80-Model-1-g-1282942)

Bill of Material:

**Please note that, different from the BOM given below, the clock frequency is now 16 Mhz instead of 20 MHz. So you will need a 16 MHz crystal instead of the listed 20 MHz crystal. The `Makefile` allows specification of the clock frequency. The default firmware supplied here, `talker80-firmware.hex`, runs at 16 Mhz by now. If you have a 20 MHz crystal at hand, that should also work, but you will need to change the `Makefile` accordingly and recompile the firmware with WinAVR.**

![BOM](schematics/m1/BOM.jpg) 

#### Model 3 / 4 Version

[Gerbers of the Model 3 / 4 version can be found here.](gerbers/m3m4/talker80-m3m4.zip) 

![BOM](schematics/m3m4/BOM.jpg) 


#### Tipps 
I recommend the use of standard stackable Arduino Headers for J1 and J2 (instead of soldering the daughter board in permanently). For the amplifier board, J6 and J7 are simple pin headers that make the connection to the amplifier board: 

![Amplifier](images/amp.jpg) 

The form factors in the above BOM are **for illustration only.** Instead of ceramic disc capacitors, I have used ceramic multilayer capacitors mostly. I recommend using DIP sockets for all chips. The values for the pots / trimmers are 503, 503, and 201 (speaker volume). 


## Talker/80 Control Bytes 

These are the control bytes that are ONLY understood in the EPSON and DECtalk modes, in order to prevent interference with screen printing (TRS Voice Synth) and pitch control bit (VS-100). However, you can change the firmware if desired to change this. 

Default settings are shown in **bold**:

### Model 3 / 4 Version

There are a number of demo programs.

The main disk is called
[`talker80.hfe`](trs80/m3m4/images/talker80.hfe) (or
[`talker80.jv3`](trs80/m1/images/talker80.jve)). The disk loads with
Model 3 LDOS 3.5.1. Note that each BASIC (`BAS`) program is also
included as a non-tokenized `TXT` file, to facilitate loading into
another BASIC, e.g., Microsoft BASIC. Microsoft BASIC was the default
TRSDOS / LDOS 6.3.1. Some work might be required to get the programs
to run with Microsoft BASIC (e.g, ELIZA80). Also, the VS-100 software
only seems to work with LDOS 3.5.1 (Model 3 mode). 

So, the DSK contains the following (plus the `TXT` versions of the
BASIC programs):
